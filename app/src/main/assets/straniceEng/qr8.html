				<p> <b>The period of history since 1941</b> is shown through several units, mostly with photographs, copies of documents and three-dimensional artefacts. The exhibition has a chronological flow, which starts with the outbreak and during World War II showing weapons and uniforms of the occupying forces. After the occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia it is shown the formation of the quisling Independent State of Croatia and its crimes, as well as artefacts and photographs that testify of outbreak of the uprising in Bosanska Krajina in 1941 until the final liberation in 1945. The different events are shown in the units such as the Kozara Offensive, background work, Medical Corps, etc. As a separate exhibition, which is extremely expressive, stands out the exhibition “Jasenovac, the System of Ustasha Death Camps”.</p>
