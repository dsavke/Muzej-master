			<h1>the Ottoman period</h1>
			<div class="tekst">
				<p>The multitude and richness of the Museum artefacts <b>from the Ottoman period from XVI until XIX century</b> (1527-1878) are the artefacts of the Muslim applied art, among which the artefacts imported from the Middle East stand out. The most common is the written material (berats, fermans, buyruldus, sicils), while the most interesting are the museum artefacts such as weapons and military equipment (swords, sabers, maces, scimitars, baltas (kind of an ax), spears, helmets, shields, katis (leather or metal rectangular box on the belt where bullets are held), zejtinlica (where one kept oil for cleaning the gun), fiseklijas (bandoliers), powder horns, various cannonballs, bensilah (Balkan weapons belt), but also seals, uniforms, as well as objects for daily use djugum (copper kettle for water), dimirlija (baking tray), bronze vases, copper and silver cups, spoons, knives, etc.). Special artefacts are the rebels’ military raincoat from 1875 to 1878 and Janissary uniform from Livno from the early XIX century. The period since the Berlin Congress in 1878 until the occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 provides an overview through thorough legends and copies of original documents, postcards and photographs that reflect complexity of the opportunities in our region during the turn of XX century. The interest is raised with archival materials from the history of the Museum (then Vrbas banovina) as the Decision on the Establishment, and a small number of artefacts of which part of a seal of the Vrbas banovina Ban stood out, as well as his seal. Extraordinarily preserved male and female Falcon uniform and poster of the Falcon’s rally in Banja Luka on St. Vitus Day in 1914 are of great importance as well as other original artefacts that testify about technical achievements in the first half of XX century, such as a radio or a camera. </p>
