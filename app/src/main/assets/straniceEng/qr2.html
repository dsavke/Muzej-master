			<h1>Stone Age</h1>
			<div class="tekst">
			<p>The Department of Archeology is presented with material from prehistory to the Middle Ages found at multilayer sites, which prove early and continuous settlement of the former Bosanska Krajina territory.
			The earliest remains of the Stone Age material culture, or more precisely the Old Stone Age (middle Paleolithic) are associated with the appearance of Neanderthal man from the Mousterian culture (cave Rastusa near Teslic), as well as the Cro-Magnon (homo sapiens type), Aurignacian and Gravettian culture (Pecine site in Klasnice near Banja Luka). The remains of the Middle Stone Age or Mesolithic have not been registered in the territory of Republic of Srpska until today. Archaeological testimonies of the New Stone Age or Neolithic, from the sites Silosi Krcevine, Kastel and Kovacica Durutovci are for now few in number and illustrated with a ceramic material, stone tools and weapons, and bone tools </p>
