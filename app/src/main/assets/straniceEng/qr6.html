			<h1>Late Middle Ages </h1>
			<div class="tekst">
				<p>The <b>Department of History</b> covers the period from XII century to the present. <b>The Late Middle Ages</b> (1187-1527) is represented with artefacts of the Collection of Medieval Weapons and Military Equipment, as well as the Numismatic Collection. These are remarkable specimens of swords, spears, axes and maces. Shells were used as defense against these weapons, and the one which stands exposed is a chain shirt. The Numismatic Collection of Medieval Coins is represented with examples of gold, silver and copper coins from Bosnia, Byzantine, Hungary and Dubrovnik. Particularly noteworthy are silver Hungarian coin hoards from XV to XVII century from the site Haniste, Banja Luka. All artefacts originate from the territory of the former Donji Kraji (Lower Regions), as Bosanska Krajina was called in the Middle Ages.</p>
