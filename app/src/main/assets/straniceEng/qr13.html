			<h1>History of Art </h1>

				<p>The Art Collection of the <b>Department of History of Art</b> was formed with the first collected ethnographic and historical material at the time of the establishment of the Museum of the Vrbas Banovina. In the central hall of the permanent exhibition there is a collection of applied art and art thematic section which consists of 14 historical portraits of the author Spiridon Spiro Bocaric. Modest collection of the applied art shows the civil society (interwar period), artefacts of clothing and culture of living with the formal suit and top hat of Ban Svetislav Milosavljevic, formal dresses of the Ban’s wife Nadezda Lazarevic, as well as other artefacts and photographs, which together create complexity of the collection. The thematic unit of historical portraits consists of historical portraits of the rebel leaders, the Duke of the Bosnia-Herzegovinian uprising, members of the ruling dynasty Karadjordjevic, politicians and prominent figures from social and cultural life of Banja Luka. The portrait painting of Spiro Bocaric from the first half of XX century is characterized by a distinctive inking and author’s sensibility, who linked the artistic streams of academic realism and pointillism and created a specific artistic expression.</p>
