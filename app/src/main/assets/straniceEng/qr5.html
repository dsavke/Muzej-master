			<h1>Early Medieval Age</h1>
			<div class="tekst">
				<p>The <b>Early Medieval Age</b>, a period from the second half of IV until the end of XI century, was marked with the degradation and decay of the ancient culture and civilization, and later with stabilization of now changed socio - economic circumstances and the gradual formation of early medieval states and communities. The oldest findings of this age, exhibited at the permanent exhibition, are the four Slav clay pots dating back to the end of VIII and beginning of IX century, discovered during archaeological research of the late antique basilica in the place of Vrba in Glamoc field. Next one were precious jewelry findings from the necropolis in Mahovljani and Petosevci, near Laktasi, dating from the second half of IX to XI century. The period of High Middle Ages, which encompasses the period from XII and during the first half of XIII century in our territory, is characterized by the struggle of the medieval Bosnian state for emancipation, while being in complicated religious situations and with constant pretensions of the neighboring country, Hungary. For now, we have a small number of archaeological findings on the territory of the northwestern Bosnia from this period of the Middle Ages. Such are a part of jewelry findings from the necropolis in the site of Crkvine in Sipovo and the stone block with Glagolitic inscription from Kijevac near Gradiska.</p>
