			<h1>About museum</h1>
			<div class="tekst">
			<p>The Museum of the Republic of Srpska (RS Museum) was founded on 26 September 1930, under the name the Museum of the Vrbas Banovina. The first manager of the Museum of the Vrbas Banovina was Spiridon Spiro Bocaric, an academic painter from Budva. During the first years of his work, Bocaric collected a large number of ethnographic objects of inestimable historical, national and cultural value from the surroundings of Banja Luka. During the first decade of its existence, besides the Ethnological Collection, the Historical, Archaeological and Natural History Collection were set up. The Museum has changed its name and location several times, when in 1981 as the Museum of the Bosanska Krajina (since 1967) it was finally settled under the roof of the House of Workers' Solidarity where it is still today. By the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Srpska, on 14 November 1992 it was renamed into the Museum of the Republic of Srpska and declared for a the central institution for protection of movable cultural goods.</p>
